# Review with CodeRabbit
## Instructions
Run the command without sandbox to get a CodeRabbit code review.

- If there is uncommitted code changes: `coderabbit --plain --type uncommitted`
- If there are committed changes not yet reviewed: `coderabbit --plain --type committed`

After receiving the review, fix the issues presented and report to me following:
- Comment from CodeRabbit that you received.
- The changes you made to address the comment.

Crucially, if some suggestion(s) are difficult to apply (e.g., it's overly excessive, involves a trade-off,
or is otherwise hard to judge whether to simply implement), do not apply the fix immediately.
Instead, ask me for a decision on how to proceed.
